SaaS Landing Demo

Production-minded SaaS landing demo.
Built to show clear thinking, structure, and delivery — not just visuals.

What is this

This is a minimal, finished SaaS landing built with modern Next.js architecture.

The goal is simple:
demonstrate how to launch a clean, SEO-ready commercial website quickly and without unnecessary complexity.

This is not a template.
This is a realistic MVP-level marketing site.

Who this is for

Founders launching an MVP

Startups validating an idea

Teams needing a fast marketing site

Clients reviewing delivery quality

Portfolio / demo purposes

If you need something clear, structured, and ready to deploy — this is the type of project.

What you see in 3 minutes

In just a few minutes, you can evaluate:

Clean SaaS-style UI

Clear value proposition

Realistic pricing structure

FAQ that removes objections

Contact flow (mocked intentionally)

Route-based i18n (EN / RU)

SEO-ready metadata and structure

No explanations needed.

Live demo routes

/en

/en/pricing

/en/faq

/en/contact

The root route automatically redirects to the default locale.

Why this approach

This project intentionally avoids over-engineering.

No unnecessary features.
No fake “AI”.
No animations for the sake of animation.

The focus is on:

clarity

speed

structure

trust

Exactly what early-stage products need.

Deployment

The project is Vercel-ready.

No environment variables required

No external services

One-click deploy

Limitations (intentional)

This is a marketing demo, not a full product.

Intentionally excluded:

Backend logic

Database

Authentication

Payments

Analytics

CMS

Complex animations

Each of these would increase scope without improving the demo’s purpose.

Future ideas (not implemented)

These are intentionally not included, but the architecture allows them:

Real contact submission (Server Actions)

Backend API

CMS (Sanity / Contentful)

Analytics

A/B testing

They are excluded to keep the project minimal and focused.

Summary

This project shows how to:

Think in MVP terms

Respect scope boundaries

Deliver something finished

Build trust through simplicity

It is designed to be understood without a call.
